  "whoami": "Hi, I'm Muhammed Shadil, a passionate Full Stack Developer from Kerala, India. I completed my Diploma in Computer Engineering in 2024, alongside my Higher Secondary Education in Computer Science. Currently, I’m working as a MERN Stack Trainee at Bridgeon Solutions, where I’ve gained over a year of hands-on experience with modern technologies including JavaScript, React, Redux, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. During this period, I have worked on a variety of live projects such as e-commerce platforms, learning management systems (LMS), task management applications, and other full-fledged web applications. I'm a self-learner who adapts quickly to new tools and technologies. I enjoy solving complex challenges, and I'm deeply committed to achieving excellence in my field. ",
